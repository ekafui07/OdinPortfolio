    <h6>About Me</h6>
    <p>Hello! I'm an aspiring software developer from Ghana with a strong interest in building functional, user-friendly websites. I'm currently learning web development, starting with the basics of HTML and gradually expanding 
        my skills into tools like Git and version control.</p>
    <p>I enjoy breaking down problems, learning by doing, and building simple but practical projects that reflect what I've learned. I'm curious, persistent, and committed to improving each day — whether it’s by experimenting with code, 
        studying project structure, or understanding how the web works.</p>
    <p>My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer and eventually work on real-world applications that solve meaningful problems, especially in my local community. I'm passionate about tech, self-taught learning, and 
        creating a career path through consistent effort and practice.</p>
